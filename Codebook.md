### Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S II) Dataset

This data set strike an average of mean value and standard deviation of accelerometer and gyroscope signals for six type of activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) for each of 30 volunteers.
Prefix "average_" mean "avarage value for this type of activity". More detail about estimated variables of accelerometer and gyroscope see "initial_data/features_info.txt".
